# Day 1 - Data Cleaning 🧽

## Task Summary
This task was about cleaning a messy dataset and making it ready for analysis.  
I used Python (Pandas) to do the cleaning.

## Dataset
*Name:* Medical Appointment No Shows  
*File:* KaggleV2-May-2016.csv

## Cleaning Steps I Did:
- ✅ Renamed columns to be lowercase with underscores (e.g., ScheduledDay ➡ scheduled_day)
- ✅ Fixed typo: handcap ➡ handicap
- ✅ Changed scheduled_day and appointment_day to proper date format
- ✅ Standardized values in gender and no_show (all uppercase)
- ✅ Changed patientid to integer
- ✅ Checked for duplicates (none found)
- ✅ Verified missing values (none found)

## Output
The cleaned data is saved in:  
📁 *Cleaned_Medical_Appointment_Data.csv*

## What I Learned
- How to clean real-world data with Pandas
- Why it's important to fix formats, missing data, and column names before analysi
